Current MIT students, faculty, postdocs, researchers, staff, etc. will be able to access the lectures during this two week period, synchronously or asynchronously, via the MIT Canvas course webpage (MIT internal only). Lecture recordings will be uploaded to the Canvas as soon as possible; students are not required to attend any lectures synchronously. Please see the Canvas for details on Zoom links.  The public edition of the course will only be made available after completion of the MIT course. Labs, Final Projects, Grading, and Prizes Course will be graded during MIT IAP for 6 units under P/D/F grading. Receiving a passing grade requires completion of each software lab project (through honor code, with submission required to enter lab competitions), a final project proposal/presentation or written review of a deep learning paper (submission required), and attendance/lecture viewing (through honor code). Submission of a written report or presentation of a project proposal will ensure a passing grade.  MIT students will be eligible for prizes and awards as part of the class competitions. There will be two parts to the competitions: (1) software labs and (2) final projects. More information is provided below. Winners will be announced on the last day of class, with thousands of dollars of prizes being given away!  Software labs There are three TensorFlow software lab exercises for the course, designed as iPython notebooks hosted in Google Colab. Software labs can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning. These are self-paced exercises and are designed to help you gain practical experience implementing neural networks in TensorFlow.  For registered MIT students, submission of lab materials is not necessary to get credit for the course or to pass the course.  At the end of each software lab there will be task-associated materials to submit (along with instructions) for entry into the competitions, open to MIT students and affiliates during the IAP offering. This includes MIT students/affiliates who are taking the class as listeners -- you are eligible!  These instructions are provided at the end of each of the labs. Completing these tasks and submitting your materials to Canvas will enter you into a per-lab competition. MIT students and affiliates will be eligible for prizes during the IAP offering; at the end of the course, prize-winners will be awarded with their prizes.  All competition submissions are due on January 26 at 11:59pm ET to Canvas.  For the software lab competitions, submissions will be judged on the basis of the following criteria: Strength and quality of final results (lab dependent) Soundness of implementation and approach Thoroughness and quality of provided descriptions and figures Gather.Town lab + Office Hour sessions After each day’s lecture, there will be open Office Hours in the class GatherTown, up until 3pm ET. An MIT email is required to log in and join the GatherTown. During these sessions, there will not be a walk through or dictation of the labs; the labs are designed to be self-paced and to be worked on on your own time.  The GatherTown sessions will be hosted by course staff and are held so you can: Ask questions on course lectures, labs, logistics, project, or anything else; Work on the labs in the presence of classmates/TAs/instructors; Meet classmates to find groups for the final project; Group work time for the final project; Bring the class community together. Final project To satisfy the final project requirement for this course, students will have two options: (1) write a 1 page paper review (single-spaced) on a recent deep learning paper of your choice or (2) participate and present in the project proposal pitch competition. The 1 page paper review option is straightforward, we propose some papers within this document to help you get started, and you can satisfy a passing grade with this option -- you will not be eligible for the grand prizes. On the other hand, participation in the project proposal pitch competition will equivalently satisfy your course requirements but additionally make you eligible for the grand prizes. See the section below for more details and requirements for each of these options. Paper Review Students may satisfy the final project requirement by reading and reviewing a recent deep learning paper of their choosing. In the written review, students should provide both: 1) a description of the problem, technical approach, and results of the paper; 2) critical analysis and exposition of the limitations of the work and opportunities for future work. Reviews should be submitted on Canvas by Thursday Jan 28, 2021, 11:59:59pm Eastern Time (ET).  Just a few paper options to consider...  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/69386f6bb1dfed68692a24c8686939b9-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140 https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/0e64a7b00c83e3d22ce6b3acf2c582b6-Paper.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11829.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00237-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32084340/ Project Proposal Presentation Keyword: proposal  This is a 2 week course so we do not require results or working implementations!

(see below)  Sign up to Present here: by 11:59pm ET on Wednesday Jan 27  Once you sign up, make your slide in the following Google Slides; submit by midnight on Thursday Jan 28. Please specify the project group # on your slides!!!  Things to Consider This doesn’t have to be a new deep learning method.  It can just be an interesting application that you apply some existing deep learning method to. What problem are you solving?  Are there use cases/applications?   Why do you think deep learning methods might be suited to this task?  How have people done it before? Is it a new task? If so, what are similar tasks that people have worked on?  In what aspects have they succeeded or failed?   What is your method of solving this problem? What type of model + architecture would you use?  Why?  What is the data for this task? Do you need to make a dataset or is there one publicly available? What are the characteristics of the data?  Is it sparse, messy, imbalanced?  How would you deal with that? Project Proposal Grading Rubric Project proposals will be evaluated by a panel of judges on the basis of the following three criteria: 1) novelty and impact; 2) technical soundness, feasibility, and organization, including quality of any presented results; 3) clarity and presentation. Each judge will award a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each of the criteria; the average score from each judge across these criteria will then be averaged with that of the other judges to provide the final score. The proposals with the highest final scores will be selected for prizes.   Here are the guidelines for the criteria:  Novelty and impact: encompasses the potential impact of the project idea, its novelty with respect to existing approaches. Why does the proposed work matter? What problem(s) does it solve? Why are these problems important? Technical soundness, feasibility, and organization: encompasses all technical aspects of the proposal. Do the proposed methodology and architecture make sense? Is the architecture the best suited for the proposed problem? Is deep learning the best approach for the problem? How realistic is it to implement the idea? Was there any implementation of the method? If results and data are presented, we will evaluate the strength of the results/data. Clarity and presentation: encompasses the delivery and quality of the presentation itself. Is the talk well organized? Are the slides aesthetically compelling? Is there a clear, well-delivered narrative? Are the problem and proposed method clearly presented?   Past Project Proposal Ideas Recipe Generation with RNNs Can we compress videos with CNN + RNN? Music Generation with RNNs Style Transfer Applied to X GAN’s on a new modality Summarizing text/news articles Combining news articles about similar events  Code or spec generation Multimodal speech → handwriting Generate handwriting based on keywords (i.e. cursive, slanted, neat) Predicting stock market trends Show language learners articles or videos at their level  Transfer of writing style Chemical Synthesis with Recurrent Neural networks Transfer learning to learn something in a domain for which it’s hard or risky to gather data or do training RNNs to model some type of time series data Computer vision to coach sports players Computer vision system for safety brakes or warnings  Use IBM Watson API to get the sentiment of your Facebook newsfeed Deep learning webcam to give wifi-access to friends or improve video chat in some way Domain-specific chatbot to help you perform a specific task Detect whether a signature is fraudulent Awards + Categories Final Project Awards: 1x NVIDIA RTX 3080 4x Google Home Max 3x Display Monitors  Software Lab Awards: Bose headphones (Lab 1) Display monitor (Lab 2) Bebop drone (Lab 3) Important Links and Emails Course website: http://introtodeeplearning.com Course staff: introtodeeplearning-staff@mit.edu Piazza forum (MIT only): https://piazza.com/mit/spring2021/6s191 Canvas (MIT only): https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/8291 Software lab repository: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning Lab/office hour sessions (MIT only): https://gather.town/app/56toTnlBrsKCyFgj/MITDeepLearning",https://github.com/abusufyanvu/6S191_MIT_DeepLearning,Jupyter Notebook,2022-01-16 11:01:50,2024-10-02 05:49:40,160,60,1,MIT License

LLM_Transformer_Queue,vatsalcode,"Rules In our version, of 100DaysOfCode, you need to do anything that helps you enhance your tech stack i.e. competitive coding, try learning a new language, read technical articles/ books, make open source contributions, add features to a personal project, etc.  It's okay if you are not able to submit a pull request someday, you can resume it the next day, you will still be in the competition. Remember, life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning.  Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them. (Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable)  Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.  (Optional) Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.  Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).  We start the marathon on January 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).  Benefits Coding will become a daily habit for you.  Every day that you consistently code, you’ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.  The projects that you’ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you’ll have completed several of them — and gained a wide range of experience.  Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.  You’ll get more comfortable contributing in open soruce. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.  You’ll have a pretty good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.  Increase your efficiency by checking your daily progress and analysing it.  Compare your progress with others and surpass your limits in learning each day.  Recognition You will be provided with certificates on successful completiton of 100DaysOfCode. At the end of each month, goodies will be given to the top performers. A big surprise for the overall top performers in 100DaysOfCode. Note: Only the students in MNIT/ IIIT Kota/ NIT UK are elligible for prizes/ certificates.  Pre-requisites Markdown: You need to update your README in Markdown (a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax). No need to learn it you can always refer to the guide or use an online markdown editor.  Basic git Basic knowledge of git and its workflow is a must. If you are not comfortable, feel free to ask for help.  How to participate Fork the repository. In your fork, make a folder by the name of your github account. In your folder, make a file with the name README.md We have also provided a template which you can follow to set up README.md Update the progress in your README and submit a pull request.

pylustrator,rgerum,"Visualisations of data are at the core of every publication of scientific research results. They have to be as clear as possible to facilitate the communication of research. As data can have different formats and shapes, the visualisations often have to be adapted to reflect the data as well as possible.

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,ashishpatel26,"Start here if... You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.  Competition Description The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics",https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster,Jupyter Notebook,2018-03-23 12:35:52,2024-09-30 14:34:59,75,78,1,MIT License

Phishing_Attack_Detection_With_NaturalLanguageProcessing,SuryaSrikar,"Phishing websites are fraudulent sites that impersonate a trusted party to gain access to sensitive information of an individual person or organization. Traditionally, phishing website detection is done through the usage of blacklist databases. However, due to the current, rapid development of global networking and communication technologies, there are numerous websites and it has become difficult to classify based on traditional methods since new websites are created every second. In this paper, we are proposing a real-time, anti-phishing system. In the first step, we extract the lexical and host-based properties of a website. In the second step, we combine URL (Uniform Resource Locator) features, NLP and host-based properties to train the machine learning and deep learning models. Our detection model is able to detect phishing URLs with a detection rate of 94.89%.",https://github.com/SuryaSrikar/Phishing_Attack_Detection_With_NaturalLanguageProcessing,Jupyter Notebook,2020-01-24 16:05:49,2024-08-13 05:12:11,12,6,0,MIT License

I found a csv file that has stats on most of the pokemon and I used python, seaborn and matplotlib to make some cool visualizations. This work was sampled from a cool tutorial on seaborn's great visualizations(https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial#step-1).  This covers a good summary of Seaborn’s strengths. In practice, the “well-defined set of hard things” includes: Using default themes that are aesthetically pleasing, making attractive statistical plots, visualizing information from matrices and data frames.
