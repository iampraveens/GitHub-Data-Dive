Traditionally, phishing website detection is done through the usage of blacklist databases. However, due to the current, rapid development of global networking and communication technologies, there are numerous websites and it has become difficult to classify based on traditional methods since new websites are created every second. In this paper, we are proposing a real-time, anti-phishing system. In the first step, we extract the lexical and host-based properties of a website. In the second step, we combine URL (Uniform Resource Locator) features, NLP and host-based properties to train the machine learning and deep learning models. Our detection model is able to detect phishing URLs with a detection rate of 94.89%.",https://github.com/SuryaSrikar/Phishing_Attack_Detection_With_NaturalLanguageProcessing,Jupyter Notebook,2020-01-24T16:05:49Z,2024-08-13T05:12:11Z,12,6,0,
